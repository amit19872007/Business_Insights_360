# Business_Insights_360
## Project Overview 
AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company operating across multiple countries, has relied on traditional methods like MS Excel and Power Point for data analysis and visualization. However, this approach led to less accurate and time-consuming decision-making processes. To address these challenges, they're transitioning to PowerBI for data analytics. This shift aims to facilitate faster, more accurate, and data-driven decision-making across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain aspects.
